# Lab 7: Model Implementation

**Date:** October 17, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 7

## Overview

This lab introduces students to hydrological model implementation by coding the core `run_hydromodel` function and time-stepping algorithms. Students will learn to structure computational loops for hydrological simulations and create basic visualization tools for analyzing model outputs.

## Topics Covered

- Coding the run_hydromodel function with proper structure
- Time-stepping loops for hydrological simulations
- Basic hydrograph visualization and analysis
- Model output handling and data structures
- Debugging and testing hydrological models

## Objectives

- Implement hydrological model time-stepping algorithms
- Code the run_hydromodel function with proper structure
- Create basic hydrograph visualization and analysis tools
- Understand the computational aspects of hydrological modeling

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the hydrological model implementation skills that students will need for PS2 Task 1, providing the foundation for integrated physical-statistical modeling of streamflow systems.
